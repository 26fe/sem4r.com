title:    Constants scope are different from Ruby 1.8.7 and Ruby 1.9.1
---

The following code works with ruby 1.9.1 but doesn't work with ruby 1.8.7:

{% highlight ruby %}
class A
 C = "c"
end

A.new.instance_eval do
 puts C
end
{% endhighlight %}

If you try to execute the previous code with ruby 1.8.7, you will obtain:

{% highlight irb %}
2010-02-06-constants-scope.rb:7: uninitialized constant C (NameError)
	from 2010-02-06-constants-scope.rb:6:in `instance_eval'
	from 2010-02-06-constants-scope.rb:6
{% endhighlight %}

C is not recognized as constant in 1.8.7. Ruby 1.8.7 try to resolve C is in
Object class, and doesn't found it.
Ruby 1.9.1 try to resolve C in the A class so doesn't fail!

Sem4r use heavily symbols. For example to specify the match type in keyword:

{% highlight ruby %}
keyword do
   match_type BROAD
end
{% endhighlight %}

The previous code work in ruby 1.9.1. In ruby 1.8.7 you must use:

{% highlight ruby %}
keyword do
   match_type "BROAD"
end
{% endhighlight %}
