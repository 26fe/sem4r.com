title:    Create a new campaign

The idea underline sem4r is to have the code readible as much as possible.
The code for the creation of campaign looks like more natural[1]
than a bunch of arrays and hashes.

Account exposes the method <code>create_campaign</code> than take a block.
The block specifies the campaign name, and the adgroups contained into the campaign.
The adgroup take a block that specified the criterion contained into the adgroup.

{% highlight ruby %}
campaign = account.create_campaign do
  name "new campaign #{Time.now}"
  adgroup do
    name "new adgroup #{Time.now}"
    keyword do
      text       "keyword"
      match      "BROAD"
    end
    placement do
      url "www.example.com"
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The criterion can be keyword or placement.

Putting all together:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
require 'rubygems'
require 'sem4r'
include Sem4r

adwords = Adwords.sandbox(
  :email => "<myaccount>@gmail.com",
  :password => "secret",
  :developer_token => "<myaccount>@gmail.com++EUR")

account = adwords.account.client_accounts

campaign = account.create_campaign do
  name "new campaign #{Time.now}"

  adgroup do
    name "new adgroup #{Time.now}"
    keyword do
      text       "keyword"
      match      "BROAD"
    end
    placement do
      url "www.example.com"
    end
  end
end

campaign.p_adgroups(true)
{% endhighlight %}
